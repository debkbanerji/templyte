# Templyte

Templyte is a web application which is designed to help users create and share code templates to allow for fast bootstrapping of a variety of projects.

## Features

* Users can create and upload templates that are populated with user defined variables at download time, allowing for highly customisable starter code for any project.
* Templates are language agnostic, so users are not limited according to the technologies that their projects use.
* The application contains a tutorial page that guides users through creating templates.
* Secure login through GitHub is supported.
* The application allows users to rate templates as well as leave text reviews.
* The application supports searching the database for templates based on the title or user defined tags. Partial fuzzy matching is supported, so users do not need to provide an exact much for the search term. (in terms of capitalization or spacing) Search results can also be ordered according to rating, number of downloads, creation date and last downloaded date.
